There is a function in my .Rprofile called populate.env(). I use this function to load the scripts (which I keep in "~/lib/R") in a separate namespace and attached to R's search() path. Example usage:

    populate.env("mylib","~/lib/R")

or for single files,

    populate.env("pies","~/lib/R/more-axes.r")
